            <p>
                I am passionate in technology. I studied all aspects of computer engineering, from hardware to
                software. Now, I specialize in AI and IoT technology. Of course, still into the electrical engineering
                fundamentals as well. Such as hardware and control engineering. I would describe myself in three words:
                Passionate, Outgoing and Honest. This personal motto is formed and gained from my past experience doing
                projects
                at university. I earned Fighting Spirit Award for Large Scale Integration (LSI) Design for Deep
                Reinforcement
                Learning Hardware Accelerator which the conference was held in Japan on 2022.
